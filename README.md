# CustomVisionAPI

Running steps: 
1. change the following variables to your azure account values
  - training_key = "<training_key>"
  - prediction_key = "<prediction_key>"
  - project_id = "<project_id>"
2. the same image cannot be trained again and again; so to make the code running everytime, you might need to update the images(e.g. remove one image), or the images tags (remove one tag)
